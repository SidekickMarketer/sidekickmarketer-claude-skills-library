## Finding Top 1% in Any Industry

**Research Framework:**

```
Step 1: Search "[industry] LinkedIn thought leaders 2025"
Step 2: Analyze 3-5 top profiles:
  - What hooks do they use?
  - What formats do they favor?
  - What topics get most engagement?
  - How do they show personality while staying professional?
  
Step 3: Identify what NO ONE is doing:
  - What topics are missing?
  - What angle is underserved?
  - What can THIS founder say that competitors can't?

Step 4: Document findings with SPECIFIC examples:
  - ❌ "They post thought leadership" (too vague)
  - ✅ "Opens with bold claims ('Unpopular opinion:'), uses 5-8 slide carousels for frameworks, averages 150+ comments by asking provocative questions at the end"
```

**The Differentiation Question:**
"What can THIS founder talk about that competitors CAN'T or WON'T?"

Examples:
- **Reveal:** Vera can talk about what big pharma won't (gadolinium risks, supply chain politics)
- **CMA:** Joel can talk about the realities of running a music school for 27 years

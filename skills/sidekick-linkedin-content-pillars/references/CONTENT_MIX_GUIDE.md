## Format Mix

Based on 2025 performance data:

| Text posts | 40% | Easiest to create, good engagement |
| Carousels/Docs | 25% | High dwell time, saves |
| Polls | 15% | High reach, engagement |
| Video | 10% | Growing format, personal connection |
| Multi-image | 10% | Visual storytelling |

**Adjust based on:**
- What your audience responds to
- What you can consistently produce
- Your content pillars (some pillars work better in certain formats)

## Channel Balance: Founder vs Company

| Content Type | Founder Profile | Company Page |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Personal stories | ✅ Primary | ❌ Skip |
| Industry POV | ✅ Primary | ✅ Reshare |
| Educational | ✅ Primary | ✅ Adapted version |
| Company news | ✅ Personal take | ✅ Primary |
| Case studies | ✅ Personal intro | ✅ Full version |
| Job posts | ❌ Skip | ✅ Primary |
| Culture/team | ✅ Personal angle | ✅ Primary |

**Rule:** Founder profile gets personal perspective; Company page gets institutional voice.

## Posting Frequency Guide

| Posts/Week | Suggested Split |
|------------|-----------------|
| 2 posts | 2 founder, 0-1 company |
| 3 posts | 3 founder, 1 company |
| 4 posts | 4 founder, 1-2 company |
| 5 posts | 4-5 founder, 2 company |
| Daily | 5 founder, 2-3 company |

**Why more founder posts?**
- Personal profiles get 2-5x more engagement
- Algorithm favors personal content
- Company page serves as institutional backup

## Weekly Planning Template

### 4 Posts/Week Example:

| Day | Pillar | Format | Channel |
|-----|--------|--------|---------|
| Mon | Educational | Text | Founder |
| Tue | - | - | - |
| Wed | Thought Leadership | Carousel | Founder |
| Thu | Company News | Text | Company |
| Fri | Personal/Story | Text | Founder |
| Sat | - | - | - |
| Sun | Engagement | Poll | Founder |

### Monthly View:

| Week | Focus Theme |
|------|-------------|
| Week 1 | [Pillar 1 heavy] |
| Week 2 | [Pillar 2 heavy] |
| Week 3 | [Pillar 3 heavy] |
| Week 4 | [Mix + monthly recap] |

## Seasonal Adjustments

| Season | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| Q1 (Jan-Mar) | New year content, planning themes |
| Q2 (Apr-Jun) | Industry events, conferences |
| Q3 (Jul-Aug) | Lighter content, behind-scenes |
| Q4 (Oct-Dec) | Year-end reviews, predictions for next year |

## Performance-Based Adjustments

After 1 month, review:
1. Which pillar gets most engagement?
2. Which format performs best?
3. What's driving profile views/follows?

**Adjust:**
- Increase % of top-performing pillar
- Double down on best format
- Reduce or retire underperforming pillars

**Don't adjust:**
- Based on single viral post (outliers aren't strategy)
- Too frequently (need 4-6 weeks of data)
- Without considering business goals (engagement ≠ leads)

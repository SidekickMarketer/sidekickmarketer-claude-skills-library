# Content Repurposing Guide

How to turn one content idea into multiple formats for maximum efficiency.

---

## The 1-to-5 Framework

**One core idea becomes 5 pieces of content:**

```
                    ┌─── Text Post (quick hit)
                    │
Original Idea ──────┼─── Carousel (deep dive)
                    │
                    ├─── Poll (engagement boost)
                    │
                    ├─── Video (personal connection)
                    │
                    └─── Thread/Series (extended value)
```

## Repurposing Matrix

| Original Format | Can Become | How to Transform |
|-----------------|------------|------------------|
| **Text Post** | Carousel | Expand each point into a slide |
| **Text Post** | Poll | Extract the core question |
| **Text Post** | Video | Record yourself making the same points |
| **Carousel** | Text Post | Summarize key slides into narrative |
| **Carousel** | Thread | One slide = one post in series |
| **Poll Results** | Text Post | Share insights + analysis |
| **Video** | Text Post | Transcribe key quotes |
| **Video** | Carousel | Pull key frames with captions |

---

## Text Post → Carousel

**When to convert:**
- Post performed well and has 3+ distinct points
- Topic benefits from visual structure
- You want to give the idea "new life"

**How to do it:**

| Slide # | Content |
|---------|---------|
| 1 | Hook (same as text post hook) |
| 2 | Context/Problem setup |
| 3-8 | One point per slide (expand from original) |
| 9 | Summary/Key takeaway |
| 10 | CTA + reminder to follow |

**Timing:** Wait 2-3 weeks after original text post

---

## Text Post → Poll

**When to convert:**
- Post had high engagement in comments
- There's a debatable angle
- You want to research audience opinion

**How to do it:**

```
Original post: "The best way to grow on LinkedIn is consistency, 
not virality. Here's why..."

Poll version:
"What matters MORE for LinkedIn growth?"
○ Posting consistently (even if not viral)
○ Occasional viral hits
○ Engagement on others' content
○ All three equally
```

**Follow-up:** Post results + your analysis 1 week later

---

## Text Post → Video

**When to convert:**
- Topic is personal/emotional
- You want stronger connection with audience
- Text post was well-received

**How to do it:**

| Section | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Hook | 0-5 sec | Same hook as text post |
| Context | 5-15 sec | Why this matters |
| Main points | 15-50 sec | Key insights (conversational) |
| Close | 50-60 sec | CTA, ask question |

**Format:** Vertical (9:16), captions required, face visible

---

## Carousel → Text Post Series

**When to convert:**
- Carousel had high saves
- Each slide could stand alone
- You want to extend the content lifecycle

**How to do it:**

```
Carousel with 10 slides → 5 text posts over 2-3 weeks

Post 1: Slides 1-2 (hook + context)
Post 2: Slides 3-4 (first key point, expanded)
Post 3: Slides 5-6 (second key point, expanded)
Post 4: Slides 7-8 (third key point, expanded)
Post 5: Slides 9-10 (summary + CTA to see full carousel)
```

---

## Poll → Results Post

**Always do this.** Polls get reach; results posts get authority.

**Template:**

```
I asked: "[Poll question]"

[X,XXX] people voted. Here's what surprised me:

📊 Results:
- [Option A]: XX%
- [Option B]: XX%
- [Option C]: XX%
- [Option D]: XX%

What this tells us:
[Your analysis - 3-4 sentences]

My take:
[Your opinion based on results]

What did I miss? What would you add?
```

**Timing:** Post 1-2 days after poll closes

---

## Video → Text Post

**When to convert:**
- Video had strong message but limited reach
- Quote from video is particularly powerful
- Text audience different from video audience

**How to do it:**

1. Transcribe the video (or use key quotes)
2. Pull the most powerful 2-3 sentences
3. Write text post expanding on those points
4. Optional: Include video link in comments

## Evergreen Content Rotation

**High-performing content can be reposted:**

| Content Type | Wait Time Before Repost | How to Refresh |
|--------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Text post | 3-4 months | Update hook, add new data |
| Carousel | 4-6 months | Update design, refresh examples |
| Framework | 6+ months | Refine based on feedback |
| Hot take | 2-3 months | Check if still relevant |

**Never repost:** Trend-based content, news commentary, time-sensitive takes

---

## Weekly Repurposing Workflow

**If you create 2 original pieces per week:**

| Day | Content | Source |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Monday | Original text post | New idea |
| Tuesday | Repurposed carousel | Last month's best text post |
| Wednesday | Original carousel | New idea |
| Thursday | Poll (extracted from this week's content) | Monday/Wednesday post |
| Friday | Repurposed text post | Last month's best carousel |

**Result:** 5 posts/week from only 2 original ideas

## Repurposing for Dual Channels

### Founder Post → Company Page

| If Founder Posts... | Company Page Can... |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Personal story | Reshare with "Our founder shares..." |
| Industry insight | Adapt to "Our team's perspective on..." |
| Framework/Tips | Post similar content in brand voice |
| Hot take | Skip OR soften into observation |

### Company Post → Founder Post

| If Company Posts... | Founder Can... |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Company milestone | "I'm proud to share... Here's the backstory" |
| Product announcement | "Why we built this..." |
| Team spotlight | "Working with [person] has taught me..." |
| Case study | "Here's what I learned from helping [client type]..." |

---

## Content Lifecycle Planning

**Plan repurposing when you create the original:**

```
ORIGINAL IDEA: [Title]
Published: [Date]

Repurposing Schedule:
□ Week 2: Extract poll question
□ Week 3: Post poll results + analysis  
□ Week 4: Expand into carousel
□ Month 2: Record video version
□ Month 3: Repost with fresh hook
```

## What NOT to Repurpose

❌ Content that flopped (fix the idea, don't repeat it)
❌ Time-sensitive news commentary
❌ Highly personal/vulnerable posts (feels inauthentic to repeat)
❌ Engagement bait that you're not proud of
❌ Content that got negative feedback

---

## Efficiency Metrics

**Repurposing done right:**
- 2 original ideas → 5+ pieces of content
- Top 20% of content → 80% of engagement
- Each idea → 3-month content lifecycle

**Signs you're doing it well:**
- You're posting 4-5x/week without burnout
- Your best ideas are reaching new audiences
- Engagement stays consistent across formats

*The best content creators aren't more creative. They're better at maximizing their best ideas.*

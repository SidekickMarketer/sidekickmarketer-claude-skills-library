**Examples:**

- "Founder Confessions" > "Personal Stories"
- "Industry Radar" > "News and Trends"

- "Hot Takes" > "Opinions"

## Mixing Pillars

**Rule of thumb for % allocation:**

|--------------|-------------|
| Value/Educational | 40-50% |
| Thought Leadership/POV | 20-30% |
| Personal/Human | 15-20% |
| Promotional | 5-15% |

**Never more than 20% promotional** - LinkedIn audience will tune out.

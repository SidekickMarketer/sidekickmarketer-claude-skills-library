# Common Content Pitfalls to Avoid

## Content Quality Issues
- Generic advice that works on any platform
- Ideas that are too similar to each other
- Hooks that don't create curiosity or value promise
- Overly promotional or sales-focused content
- Overly complex ideas that are hard to execute

## Trend Usage Mistakes
- Using trending topics without adding unique perspective
- Just echoing what everyone's saying
- Missing the deeper insight behind the trend

## Credibility Issues
- Forgetting to cite sources when using external research
- Making claims without backing them up
- Vague statements instead of specific examples

## Engagement CTAs to Avoid
- Yes/no questions (low engagement)
- "Do you agree?" (overused, low effort)
- Manipulative engagement bait

## Better Engagement CTAs
- "What's your take on this?"
- "Drop your best [X] tip in the comments"
- "What would you add to this list?"
- "What's your biggest challenge with [X]?"

## Citation Requirements

**When to cite sources:**
- Ideas based on trending topics from web search
- Referencing specific news, announcements, or recent events
- Using data or statistics from external sources
- Building on viral posts or thought leadership pieces

**How to cite:**
- Include SOURCE section for each idea using external info
- Format: "Based on [description] - Source: [URL or publication name]"
- Be specific about what came from source vs original analysis

**Example citations:**
- "Based on LinkedIn's Q3 2025 algorithm update - Source: LinkedIn Engineering Blog"
- "Inspired by trending discussion on AI in marketing - Source: Multiple LinkedIn conversations observed via web_search"
- "References recent announcement: OpenAI's GPT-5 launch - Source: TechCrunch article [URL]"

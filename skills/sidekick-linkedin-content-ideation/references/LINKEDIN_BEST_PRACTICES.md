# LinkedIn Best Practices

## Hook Strength
- First 1-2 lines must work standalone in feed (before "see more")
- Create curiosity, surprise, or immediate value promise

## Formatting
- Use line breaks strategically for readability
- Use bullet points sparingly but effectively
- Use emojis judiciously (1-3 per post, not excessive)
- Avoid walls of text

## Length Sweet Spots
| Format | Optimal Length |
|--------|----------------|
| Text posts | 1,200-1,800 characters |
| Carousels | 6-10 slides |
| Videos | 30-90 seconds |

## Story Structure
- Use narrative arc: setup → conflict → resolution
- Personal anecdotes and vulnerability drive connection

## Specificity
- Concrete examples, numbers, and details over vague statements
- "I increased our reply rate by 47%" beats "I improved our metrics"

## Authenticity
- Personal voice and perspective, not corporate-speak
- "Here's what I learned the hard way..." beats "Best practices include..."

## Value-First Approach
- Lead with insight/value before any self-promotion
- Give away your best stuff—it builds trust and authority

## Comment-Bait Done Right
- Posts that naturally invite response without being manipulative
- Open-ended questions work better than yes/no
- "What's your biggest challenge with [X]?" beats "Do you agree?"

## Trend Integration
- When using trends, add unique perspective
- Don't just echo what everyone's saying
- "Everyone's talking about [trend]. Here's what they're missing..."

## Algorithm Factors (What Drives Reach)
| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Dwell time | Posts that make people read/watch longer |
| Comments | Posts that spark discussion |
| Saves | Posts with reference value people want to revisit |
| Shares | Posts that make people look good by sharing |
| Profile clicks | Posts that build authority and curiosity |

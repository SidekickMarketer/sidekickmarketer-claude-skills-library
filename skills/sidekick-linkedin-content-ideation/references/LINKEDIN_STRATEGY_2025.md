| **Polls** | 1.64x | High impressions | Quick engagement, audience research |
| **Multi-image** | - | 6.60% | Company culture, events, visual stories |

### Format-Specific Guidelines

**Documents/Carousels:**
- 6-10 slides optimal
- Great for breaking down complex insights
- High dwell time = algorithm boost
- Save/repost actions are strongest reach drivers

**Video:**
- **60-90 seconds** maximum for engagement
- **Vertical format** for mobile (88% browse on mobile)
- Hook in first 3 seconds
- Short-form outperforms long-form

**Text Posts:**
- Ideal length: **600-1,200 characters**
- White space increases performance by **+25%**
- Strong closing statement boosts engagement **20-40%**

**Polls:**
- Top performer for reach (1.64x multiplier)
- Use for audience research + engagement
- Keep options clear and debatable

**Links:**
- No longer heavily penalized (5% reach gain in 2025)
- Best practice: Short caption (<300 words) + link
- Alternative: Link in first comment still works

## Algorithm Mechanics

### What LinkedIn Prioritizes
1. **Dwell time** - How long people spend reading/watching
2. **Comments** - #1 factor for visibility
3. **Saves** - Strong signal of value
4. **Reposts** - Especially "instant reposts"
5. **Relevance** - Content matched to professional interests
6. **Expertise signals** - Not just reach, actual knowledge

### What LinkedIn Deprioritizes
- Generic content that could be on any platform
- Engagement bait without substance
- Posts that take users off-platform (though less penalized now)
- High-frequency low-quality posting

### Content Lifespan
LinkedIn is **no longer a 24-hour platform**. Posts that spark meaningful conversations can stay in feeds for **2-3 weeks**.

## Engagement Benchmarks

### What's a "Good" Engagement Rate?
| Level | Engagement Rate |
|-------|-----------------|
| Below average | <2% |
| Average | 2-4% |
| Good | 4-6% |
| Excellent | >6% |

**2025 Average:** 3.85-5.20% (varies by source)

### Growth by Account Size
| Follower Count | YoY Growth Rate |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 1K-5K | 40.75% |
| 5K-10K | 35.2% |
| 10K-50K | 28.4% |
| 100K-1M | 21.6% |

**Insight:** Smaller accounts can grow faster. Don't compare yourself to mega-influencers.

## Proven Engagement Strategies

### The Comment Strategy
Posting **10 quality comments daily** for one month yields:
- **+40%** profile views
- **+25%** engagement on your own content
- **+20%** follower/connection growth

### Trending Topics
Tapping into LinkedIn Trending Topics can get **+50% additional reach**.

### Tagging Best Practices
- Only tag people **likely to respond**
- Limit to **5 mentions max** per post
- Empty tags hurt performance

### Posting Frequency
- **Optimal:** 2-4 times per week
- Daily posting works if quality stays high
- Over-posting reduces per-post engagement

### Timing
- Engage with comments **immediately after posting**
- First hour interactions boost visibility
- But content lifespan is now 2-3 weeks, so don't obsess

## Personal vs Company Pages

**Personal profiles outperform company pages for:**
- Engagement rates
- Connection/trust building
- Direct lead generation

**Company pages work for:**
- Brand awareness
- Job postings
- Official announcements

**Strategy:** Use personal profiles for thought leadership and engagement, company pages for brand presence.

---

## What NOT to Do

1. **Don't post-and-ghost** - Respond to comments, especially in first hour
2. **Don't use empty engagement bait** - "Agree?" without substance
3. **Don't over-tag** - Only people who will actually engage
4. **Don't ignore mobile** - 88% of users are on mobile
5. **Don't chase vanity metrics** - Comments > likes for algorithm
6. **Don't copy-paste generic content** - Platform rewards authentic expertise

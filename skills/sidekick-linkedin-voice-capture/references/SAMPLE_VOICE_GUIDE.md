# Sarah Chen - LinkedIn Voice Guide

**For:** TechFlow Solutions
**Created:** November 2025
**Based on:** 12 existing LinkedIn posts, 2 podcast interviews, email samples

## Voice Summary

Sarah writes like she's having a direct conversation with a peer who's slightly behind her on the same journey. She's confident but not arrogant, shares failures openly, and has a gift for making complex B2B concepts feel simple. Her posts feel like advice from a smart friend who's been there, not a thought leader performing for an audience.

## Tone Profile

| Dimension | Her Style | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Formality | Casual-professional | Uses contractions, occasional slang ("wild," "game-changer"), but never unprofessional |
| Confidence | Bold but earned | Makes strong claims, but backs them with experience. "Here's what I learned" not "Here's the truth" |
| Humor | Dry, self-deprecating | Makes fun of her own mistakes. Never punches down. Occasional "lol" |
| Storytelling | Experience-first | Always starts with what happened, then extracts the lesson |
| Vulnerability | Selectively open | Shares failures and struggles, but from a place of having learned. Not raw venting |

## Language Patterns

### Sentence Structure
- Mix of short punchy sentences and medium-length explanations
- Average sentence: 12-15 words
- Uses fragments for emphasis: "Big mistake." "Game changer." "Here's the thing."
- Rarely uses complex sentences with multiple clauses

### Vocabulary
- **Technical level:** Medium - explains concepts but assumes business literacy
- **Industry terms she uses naturally:** ARR, churn, ICP, PLG, GTM, "burning runway"
- **Words she favors:** "actually," "honestly," "here's the thing," "wild," "the reality is"
- **Words to avoid (don't sound like her):** "leverage," "synergy," "circle back," "learnings," "at the end of the day"

### Contractions
Always uses contractions: "don't," "won't," "here's," "that's." Never "do not" or "will not."

### Signature Phrases

**Opening hooks:**
- "Here's something nobody told me about [X]..."
- "I used to think [common belief]. Then [experience happened]."
- "Unpopular opinion: [take]"
- "Real talk about [topic]:"

**Transitions:**
- "Here's the thing..."
- "But here's what actually happened..."
- "The reality is..."
- "What I didn't expect was..."

**Closings:**
- "Would love to hear if you've experienced this too."
- "Still figuring this out. What's worked for you?"
- "Curious what you think."
- Rarely uses "Let me know in the comments!" - feels too performative for her

**Catch phrases:**
- "The hard way" (as in "I learned the hard way")
- "Plot twist:" before revealing unexpected outcomes
- "Spoiler alert:" before lessons learned
- "Not gonna lie" before admitting something uncomfortable

## Content Preferences

### Topics She Loves
1. **Founder mental health** - She's passionate about the emotional side of building companies
2. **Hiring mistakes** - Loves sharing what she got wrong and why
3. **Revenue operations** - Her area of expertise, speaks with authority
4. **Remote team dynamics** - Building culture across timezones

### Her Hot Takes
- "Most founders raise too early. Bootstrap until you can't."
- "Culture decks are meaningless. Culture is what you tolerate."
- "Your first 10 hires matter more than your first 10 customers."

### Topics to Avoid
- **Politics** - She never touches this, even tangentially
- **Crypto/Web3** - Not her space, doesn't comment
- **Hustle culture glorification** - Actively pushes back against "grind" mentality

## POV & Values

### Core Beliefs
- Building a company should not destroy your health or relationships
- Transparency with your team is non-negotiable, even when it's hard
- Speed beats perfection in early-stage companies
- Most business advice is context-dependent, not universal truth

### What Frustrates Her
- Founders who perform success but are struggling privately
- VCs giving advice they've never had to execute
- "Best practices" applied without understanding context
- LinkedIn posts that are humble-brags disguised as lessons

### What Excites Her
- Founders being honest about struggles
- Creative solutions to hard problems
- Small wins that compound over time
- People who admit they don't have it figured out

## Emoji & Formatting

### Emoji Usage
- **Frequency:** Light - maybe 1-2 per post, sometimes none
- **Types she uses:** 😅 (self-deprecating), 👇 (pointing to content), 🎯 (when something hits), 💡 (insights)
- **Types she avoids:** 🔥, 💪, 🚀, 🙌 (feel too "LinkedIn influencer" for her)

### Formatting Preferences
- Uses line breaks for readability
- Rarely uses bullet points in posts (prefers flowing narrative)
- Never uses ALL CAPS for emphasis
- Occasional **bold** for key phrases, but sparingly

## Ghostwriting Checklist

Before publishing, verify:
- [ ] Sounds like something she'd actually say out loud
- [ ] Uses her vocabulary, not generic business speak
- [ ] Matches her casual-professional formality level
- [ ] Starts with experience/story, not abstract advice
- [ ] Avoids phrases on her "don't use" list
- [ ] Emoji usage is light and matches her style
- [ ] CTA feels natural, not performative
- [ ] Could pass the "would she post this without major edits" test

## Example Voice Comparison

### Generic LinkedIn voice:
> I'm excited to share that we've achieved significant growth this quarter! Our team has been working hard and the results speak for themselves. Grateful for the journey and looking forward to what's next! 🚀💪

### Sarah's voice:
> We just hit $2M ARR. Wild.
>
> 18 months ago I wasn't sure we'd make payroll.
>
> Not gonna lie, I still check our bank balance every morning out of habit. Some founder anxiety never goes away, I guess.
>
> Here's what actually got us here: firing our biggest customer.
>
> They were 40% of our revenue but demanded 80% of our attention. The month after we let them go was terrifying. But it forced us to build a real sales motion instead of depending on one whale.
>
> Plot twist: we replaced that revenue in 90 days with 12 smaller customers who actually fit our ICP.
>
> Sometimes the scariest business decision is the right one.
>
> Anyone else have a "this is terrifying but necessary" moment in their company? Curious to hear your stories.

## Sample Posts in Her Voice

### Sample 1: Hiring Mistake

> I fired someone after 3 weeks last month.
>
> Here's the thing: I knew in week 1 it wasn't working.
>
> But I kept thinking "give it time," "maybe they're just ramping," "hiring is expensive, make it work."
>
> All the excuses founders tell themselves.
>
> The reality is, when you know, you know. Your gut picks up on misalignment way before your brain admits it.
>
> Waiting another 2 weeks didn't help anyone. It just made the conversation harder and wasted their time too.
>
> Lesson I keep relearning: slow to hire, fast to fire isn't just a cliché. It's the kindest thing for everyone involved.
>
> What's a hiring lesson you had to learn the hard way?

### Sample 2: Founder Mental Health

> Real talk about founder mental health:
>
> I had a panic attack in a board meeting last year.
>
> Not like "I was stressed." Like, couldn't breathe, had to excuse myself, sat in the bathroom for 20 minutes trying to remember how lungs work.
>
> I didn't tell anyone for months. Just pretended it didn't happen.
>
> Here's what I wish someone had told me earlier: this is normal. Not okay, but normal.
>
> Building a company while pretending you have it together is exhausting. The performance of confidence takes more energy than the actual work.
>
> Now I have a therapist, a coach, and a founder group I actually tell the truth to.
>
> Not sharing this for sympathy. Sharing because I know someone reading this is white-knuckling it and thinking they're the only one.
>
> You're not. And it doesn't have to be this way.

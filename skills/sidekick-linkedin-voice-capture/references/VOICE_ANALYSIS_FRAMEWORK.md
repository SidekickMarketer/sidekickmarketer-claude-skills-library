# Voice Analysis Framework

How to analyze voice samples (posts, emails, transcripts) to extract a founder's authentic voice.

## What to Collect

**Best samples (in order of quality):**
1. Existing LinkedIn posts they wrote themselves
2. Long-form articles or blog posts
3. Podcast/video transcripts
4. Email threads (with permission)
5. Slack messages or internal comms
6. Interview transcripts

**Minimum:** 5-10 samples, ideally 1,000+ words total

## Analysis Dimensions

### 1. Sentence Structure

| Pattern | What to Look For |
|---------|------------------|
| Length | Average words per sentence (short: <15, medium: 15-25, long: >25) |
| Complexity | Simple or compound sentences? Lots of clauses? |
| Rhythm | Punchy? Flowing? Mix? |
| Fragments | Do they use sentence fragments for effect? |

### 2. Vocabulary

| Pattern | What to Look For |
|---------|------------------|
| Technical level | Do they explain terms or assume knowledge? |
| Jargon | What industry terms do they use naturally? |
| Sophistication | SAT words or everyday language? |
| Contractions | "Don't" vs "do not"? |

### 3. Tone Markers

| Dimension | Spectrum |
|-----------|----------|
| Formality | Casual ←→ Professional |
| Confidence | Humble ←→ Bold |
| Emotion | Reserved ←→ Expressive |
| Authority | Peer ←→ Expert |

### 4. Personality Signals

Look for:
- **Humor:** How often? What type? (Dry, self-deprecating, playful)
- **Vulnerability:** Do they share struggles? How openly?
- **Opinions:** Strong stances or balanced perspectives?
- **Stories:** Data-driven or anecdotal?

### 5. Structural Patterns

How do they typically:
- **Open:** Question? Bold statement? Story? Data?
- **Transition:** "Here's the thing...", "But wait...", "The truth is..."
- **Close:** CTA? Question? Summary? Mic drop?

### 6. Distinctive Elements

Capture:
- Phrases they repeat
- Metaphors they use
- How they express agreement/disagreement
- Exclamation point usage
- Emoji patterns (if any)

## Validation Test

After creating voice guide, write a sample post and check:

1. **Read aloud test:** Does it sound like them speaking?
2. **Phrase check:** Are signature phrases included naturally?
3. **Tone match:** Does formality level match?
4. **Anti-pattern check:** Did you avoid things they wouldn't say?
5. **Client test:** Would they post this without major edits?

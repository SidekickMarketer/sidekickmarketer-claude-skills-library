[PROBLEM or MYTH statement - what people get wrong]

[THE TRUTH or SOLUTION - what actually works]

[BRIEF EXPLANATION - why this matters]

**Example:**
```
Most beginners make this mistake without even knowing it. 🎸

They practice the same thing over and over—but never actually improve.

Here's why: repetition without intention doesn't build skill. You need focused practice with specific goals.

Try this instead: Set a 3-minute timer. Focus on ONE section. Rest. Repeat.

Save this for your next practice session 📌

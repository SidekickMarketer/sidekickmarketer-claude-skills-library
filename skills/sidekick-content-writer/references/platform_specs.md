# Platform Specifications

## Instagram

### Character Limits
| Element | Limit | Optimal |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Caption | 2,200 | 125-200 (single), 300-500+ (carousel/educational) |
| Bio | 150 | Use all of it |
| Hashtags | 30 max | 5-10 recommended |

> **Note for Niche/Educational Accounts:** Storytelling-driven accounts (music schools, coaches, educators) benefit from longer captions (300-500+ chars) on carousels and proof content. This increases dwell time and builds authority. Generic consumer brands should stay shorter.

### Caption Structure
```
[HOOK - First line, visible before "...more"]

[BODY - 2-4 short paragraphs]

[CTA - Clear action]

[HASHTAGS - End of caption or first comment]
```

### Best Practices
- Hook MUST be in first line (only visible part)
- Use line breaks for readability
- Emojis: 2-4 per post (moderate)
- Hashtags: Mix of sizes (small, medium, large)
- No clickable links in captions

### Optimal Posting Times
- Weekdays: 11am-1pm, 7pm-9pm
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Avoid: Late night, early morning

## Facebook

[BODY - 1-2 sentences max]

## Google Business Profile

### Character Limits
| Element | Limit | Optimal |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Post text | 1,500 chars | 80-150 words (400-750 chars) |
| CTA button | Pre-set options | Use them! |
| Hashtags | N/A | Don't use |

> **SEO vs. Readability:** 80-150 words balances keyword density for local SEO with user engagement. Front-load important keywords (e.g., "Piano lessons in Cincinnati"). Longer posts (150-300 words) can work for competitive markets but risk losing reader attention.

### Post Types
- **Update:** General business news
- **Offer:** Promotions with dates
- **Event:** With date/time
- **Product:** Feature specific offerings

### Caption Structure
```
[VALUE STATEMENT - What you offer/update]

[BRIEF CONTEXT - 1-2 sentences]

[CTA - Direct action with contact info]
```

### Best Practices
- Business-focused messaging
- Include keywords for local SEO
- NO hashtags
- Emojis: 0-1 (minimal)
- Always include CTA with contact method
- Posts expire after 7 days (except Events)

### Optimal Posting
- 2-3x per week minimum
- Mix post types (offers, updates, events)
- Include photos with every post

## Adaptation Rules

When adapting content across platforms:

1. **Never copy-paste identical captions**
2. **Shorten for Facebook** (IG → FB = reduce by 50-75%)
3. **Remove hashtags for GBP**
4. **Add direct links for FB** (vs. "link in bio" for IG)
5. **Adjust emoji density** per platform
6. **Match tone** to platform culture
